# SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT

0x15. C - Simple Shell

Write a simple UNIX command interpreter.



## Shell Concept.

The most generic sense of the term shell means any program that users employ to

type commands. A shell hides the details of the underlying operating system and

manages the technical details of the operating system kernel interface, which is

the lowest-level, or inner-most component of most operating systems.
